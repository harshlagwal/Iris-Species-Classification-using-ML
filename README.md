# Iris-Species-Classification-using-ML
Project Overview:

This project applies machine learning to classify iris flower species using the famous Iris dataset. The workflow includes data loading, visualization, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison of several algorithms.

Key Steps
Data Loading & Exploration
The dataset is loaded and basic statistics are explored. Visualizations such as histograms, pairplots, boxplots, violin plots, and heatmaps help understand feature distributions and relationships.

Preprocessing
Features are separated from labels, and the data is split into training and testing sets. Feature scaling is performed to improve model performance.

Model Training & Evaluation
Multiple classifiers (KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest) are trained and evaluated. Accuracy scores and classification reports are generated for each model.

Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid Search CV is used to optimize KNN parameters for better accuracy.

Visualization
Confusion matrices and other plots are used to visualize model performance and feature relationships.

Deployment (Optional)
The trained model can be deployed using a simple web app (e.g., Streamlit) for interactive predictions.

Outcome
The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a machine learning classifier, comparing models, and visualizing results. It provides a practical example for beginners to learn data science and ML workflows.
